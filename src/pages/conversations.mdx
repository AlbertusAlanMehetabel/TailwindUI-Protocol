# Conversations

Conversations are an essential part of Protocol â€” they are the containers for the messages between you, your contacts, and groups. On this page, weâ€™ll dive into the different conversation endpoints you can use to manage conversations programmatically. We'll look at how to query, create, update, and delete conversations. {{ className: 'lead' }}

## The conversation model

The conversation model contains all the information about the conversations between you and your contacts. In addition, conversations can also be group-based with more than one contact, they can have a pinned message, and they can be muted.

### Properties

<Properties>
  <Property name="id" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the conversation.
  </Property>
  <Property name="contact_id" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the other contact in the conversation.
  </Property>
  <Property name="pinned_message_id" type="string">
    Unique identifier for the pinned message.
  </Property>
  <Property name="is_pinned" type="boolean">
    Whether or not the conversation has been pinned.
  </Property>
  <Property name="is_muted" type="boolean">
    Whether or not the conversation has been muted.
  </Property>
  <Property name="last_active_at" type="timestamp">
    Timestamp of when the conversation was last active.
  </Property>
  <Property name="last_opened_at" type="timestamp">
    Timestamp of when the conversation was last opened by the authenticated
    user.
  </Property>
  <Property name="created_at" type="timestamp">
    Timestamp of when the conversation was created.
  </Property>
  <Property name="archived_at" type="timestamp">
    Timestamp of when the conversation was archived.
  </Property>
</Properties>
